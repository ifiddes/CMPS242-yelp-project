Kamala:
Implemented Naive bayes baseline and generated results for the same. Generated wordvector embeddings by modifying Google's word2vec tutorial implementation.Also implemented multi-class logistic regression from scratch.  

Ian:
Generated visualisations of results for naive bayes. Ran ordinal regression for different word vector embeddings. Also generated word vector embeddings based on a different implementation. 

Jacob:
Implemented ordinal regression from scratch

Brett:
Wrote down the mathematical formulation for our approach in a previous report
